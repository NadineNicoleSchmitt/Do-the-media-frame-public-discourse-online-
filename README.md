# Does the media frame public discourse online? 
## The impact of content variations of German news articles related to Covid-19 on the public discourse online by using NLP methods to analyze their comments

## Data
I scraped news articles and their comments from 3 different news outlets (Zeit, Welt, Handelsblatt) related to the topic of Covid-19 from 01.01.2020 to 30.06.2023. I used [WebScraper.io](https://webscraper.io/) (Google Chrome Extension) and R scripts. The files can be found [here](Data/Datafiles)
